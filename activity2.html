					I used to think that I wasn't fine enough
					<br>
					And I used to think that I wasn't wild enough
					<br>
					But I won't waste my time tryna figure out why you playin' games
					<br>
					What's this all about?
					<br>
					And I can't believe
					<br>
					You're hurting me
					<br>
					I met your girl, what a difference
					<br>
					What you see in her
					<br>
					You ain't seen in me
					<br>
					But I guess it was all just make-believe
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					Oh, love
					<br>
					Never knew what I was missin'
					<br>
					But I knew once we start kissin'
					<br>
					I found
					<br>
					Love
					<br>
					Never knew what I was missin'
					<br>
					But I knew once we start kissin'
					<br>
					I found, found you
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					Now you're gone, what am I gonna do?
					<br>
					So empty
					<br>
					My heart, my soul, can't go on
					<br>
					Go on, without you
					<br>
					My rainy days fade away when you
					<br>
					Come around, please tell me, baby
					<br>
					Why you go so far away?
					<br>
					Why you go?
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					Love
					<br>
					Never knew what I was missin'
					<br>
					But I knew once we start kissin'
					<br>
					I found
					<br>
					Love
					<br>
					Never knew what I was missin'
					<br>
					But I knew once we start kissin'
					<br>
					I found, I found you
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					Who would have known I'd find you?
					<br>
					Ooh
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					Now you're gone, what am I gonna do?
					<br>
					So empty
					<br>
					My heart, my soul, can't go on
					<br>
					Go on, baby, without you
					<br>
					Rainy days fade away
					<br>
					When you come around
					<br>
					Say you're here to stay
					<br>
					With me, boy
					<br>
					I don't want you to leave me
					<br>
					I, I need you
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					Love
					<br>
					Never knew what I was missin' (I never knew)
					<br>
					But I knew once we start kissin'
					<br>
					I found (found love)
					<br>
					Love
					<br>
					Never knew what (I never) I was missin' (never, never)
					<br>
					But I knew once we start kissin'
					<br>
					I found (I found, I found)
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					Love
					<br>
					Never knew what I was missin'
					<br>
					But I knew once we start kissin'
					<br>
					I found
